HighSchoolJava
==============

Projects from AP Computer Science in 11th grade.

This is pretty much everything I've done in Java. Most of it is pretty sloppy and just thrown together, but I'm really
proud of the "BankAccount" project and also the slotMachine project. Feel free to look through them and mess around with 
them. If I find more projects I'll upload them as well.
